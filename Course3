Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Divide and Conquer Algorithms
It helped me learn how I can divide a big problem into smaller chunks and then solve a problem. Evey problem could have different solution and can be solved with different algos. It can also be used in our day to day lives.
